# 🧬 Antibiotic Discovery & Resistance
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for a university project analyzing bacterial resistance and identifying antibiotic-producing microbes from a soil sample. The project uses real-world data from ECDC AMR Surveillance Database and Ribosomal Database Project. 

## 📁 Project Structure

- `hospital_simulation.ipynb`  
  Simulates hospital infection control scenarios using dual antibiotic application strategies.

- `identifying_bacteria_species.ipynb`  
  Identifies antibiotics and their associated producer species based on experimental data from our class lab session.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Levenshtein  
- **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook

## 🎯 Objectives

- Match DNA sequence data to identify antibiotic-producing species.
- Practice data analysis and visualization using real biological data.
- Investigate real-world antimicrobial resistance patterns in hospital settings.
